6502 fpga/cpld interface fun
============================

Experimental stuff for using the Mojo FPGA dev board with a WDC 65C02 MPU. 

The plan, using logic to do:

- WORKING: 1Mhz clock with enable switch (and single step button) 
- Bus decoding to select the right chip
- Other bus stuff:
    - use Mojo - AVR serial to send address bus to PC to see what's on it
    - interface 6502 with SPI SRAM 
- FPGA can be used as ROM to get the party started

... probably more.
